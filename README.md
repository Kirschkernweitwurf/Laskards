## About the Game

You play against different bosses.
Each boss has its own deck and playstyle.

The core idea:
Everything is driven by cards.

Units can be modified mid-game.
Values such as gained energy or card draw can change dynamically.
Strategy comes from combining positioning, resource- and deck management.

## Core Gameplay

### Duels

* When a unit reaches the last row, it deals damage and dies.
* Whoever reaches 0 HP first loses.

---

### Deck System

You play with two decks:

**Main Deck**
Contains action cards and stronger units.

**Raven Deck**
Contains 8 ravens.
Ravens cost 0 energy and help stabilize the game when energy is low.
